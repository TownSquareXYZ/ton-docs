## Introduction

This document provides a list of TVM instructions along with their opcodes and mnemonics.

:::info
[**TVM.pdf**](https://ton.org/tvm.pdf) concept document for TON Virtual Machine (may include outdated information).
:::

Fift is a stack-based programming language designed to manage TON smart contracts. The Fift assembler is a Fift library that converts mnemonics of TVM instructions into their binary representation.

A description of Fift, including an introduction to the Fift assembler, can be found [here](https://github.com/Piterden/TON-docs/blob/master/Fift.%20A%20Brief%20Introduction.md).

This document specifies the corresponding mnemonic for each instruction.

Note the following:

1. Fift is a stack-based language, therefore all the arguments of any instruction are written before it (e.g. [`5 PUSHINT`](#instr-pushint-4), [`s0 s4 XCHG`](#instr-xchg-ij)).
2. Stack registers are denoted by `s0, s1, ..., s15`. Other stack registers (up to 255) are denoted by `i s()` (e.g. `100 s()`).
3. Control registers are denoted by `c0, c1, ..., c15`.

### Gas prices

The gas price of each instruction is specified in this document. The basic gas price of an instruction is `10 + b`, where `b` is the instruction length in bits. Some operations have additional fees:

1. _Parsing cells_: Transforming a cell into a slice costs **100 gas units** if the cell is loading for the first time and **25** for subsequent loads during the same transaction. For such instructions, two gas prices are specified (e.g. [`CTOS`](#instr-ctos): `118/43`).
2. _Cell creation_: **500 gas units**.
3. _Throwing exceptions_: **50 gas units**. In this document the exception fee is only specified for an instruction if its primary purpose is to throw (e.g. [`THROWIF`](#instr-throwif-short), [`FITS`](#instr-fits)). If the instruction only throws in some cases, two gas prices are specified (e.g. [`FITS`](#instr-fits): `26/76`).
4. _Tuple creation_: **1 gas unit** for every tuple element.
5. _Implicit jumps_: **10 gas units** for an implicit jump, **5 gas units** for an implicit back jump. This fee is not a part of any instruction.
6. _Moving stack elements between continuations_: **1 gas unit** per element, however moving the first 32 elements is free.

### Quick search

:::info

A full machine-readable list of TVM instructions is available [here](https://github.com/ton-community/ton-docs/blob/main/docs/learn/tvm-instructions/instructions.csv).
:::

Each section of TVM Instructions includes a built-in search component for finding opcodes specific to that section as well.

On this page, however, the search covers all existing opcodes, providing a comprehensive search option across the entire opcode range.
