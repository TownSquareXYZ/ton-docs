## Contribute rules

### Documentation maintain community

TON Documentation is entirely open source. Community enthusiasts and early TON contributors have played a key role in creating this open-source TON documentation by turning their notes into detailed pages.

It was initially written by TON [contributors](/v3/contribute/maintainers/) and supported by [TON Studio](https://tonstudio.io/).
We aim to educate users about TON through explicit, easily searchable content that appeals to technical experts and casual readers.

### 开发

### 拉取请求

- Learn the documentation development flow from a [ton-docs/README.md](https://github.com/ton-community/ton-docs?tab=readme-ov-file#set-up-your-environment-%EF%B8%8F) document.

#### Best practices for pull requests

1. **保持你的拉取请求小**。较小的拉取请求（大约 300 行差异）更容易审查，也更有可能被合并。确保拉取请求只做一件事，否则就请拆分它。
2. **使用描述性标题**。建议遵循提交消息的惯例。
3. **Test your changes**. Run build locally, and make sure you have no crashes.
4. **Use soft wrap**: Don't wrap lines at 80 characters; configure your editor to soft-wrap.
