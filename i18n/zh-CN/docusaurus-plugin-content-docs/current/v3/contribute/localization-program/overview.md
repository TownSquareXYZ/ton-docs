# Localization

The localization is a collaborative effort to translate various TON-related documents into multiple languages, making the website accessible to billions of non-English speakers worldwide.

## System design philosophy

![工作原理](/img/localizationProgramGuideline/localization-program.png)

The localization process is fully maintained by [TownSquare Labs](https://github.com/TownSquareXYZ).

TownSquare is committed to creating an open infrastructure for multilingual community collaboration to advance TON to a better phase, which includes:

- **适用于多语言社区**\
   程序支持多种语言，确保包容性，方便来自不同语言背景的用户使用。

- **Automate development, integration, and deployment**\
   The program simplifies development, integration, and deployment through automation tools, reducing manual efforts and enhancing efficiency and consistency across localization efforts.

- **Separation of roles for developer, translator, and verifier**\
   Our approach divides the responsibilities of developers, translators, and verifiers, allowing each role to focus on their tasks and ensuring high-quality translations and seamless collaboration without role conflicts.

- **社区贡献奖励**
   我们为在本地化过程中做出贡献的社区成员提供奖励。这既鼓励了积极参与，又奖励了那些帮助改进程序的人，培养了主人翁意识和社区精神。

- **集成先进的人工智能系统**
   先进的人工智能系统通过提供智能建议和自动执行重复性任务，不仅提高翻译准确性和效率，也确保能以更少的工作量获得高质量的结果。

This project is designed to support speakers of multiple languages and serve the global developer ecosystem.
